            <p>Welcome to my first web page!  I currently live in Philadelphia with my wife and two sons.  I received a BS in Computer Science </p>
            <p>from Rutgers University and worked as a Software Engineer for 5 years before leaving the IT industry and starting a management recruiting </p>
            <p>agency with my wife.  We have owned and operated this business for the last 14 years.  Although the business has been and continues to be </p>
            <p>successful, I have always enjoyed coding and application development and decided it was time to re-enter the IT workforce again. </p>
